## Open5GS with EAP-TLS
For my master thesis I implemented the additional authentication mechanism EAP-TLS in the Open5GS core.

## Getting Started
To be able to run this on your machine follow the [Build from Source Manual] (https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/02-building-open5gs-from-sources/)
Just use this repository instead of the open5GS one.

## Test with Client
If you want to test the core with EAP-TLS then use the [N3IWF] () and the [UE] ().
